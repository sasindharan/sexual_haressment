# Sexual Harassment Detection Project

**Detailed Description of Machine Learning Algorithms:**
Provide a brief overview of each machine learning algorithm used in the project, including their strengths and weaknesses in the context of sexual harassment detection.
Explain how each algorithm is applied to the specific modality (text, images, audio) for harassment detection.
**Data Preprocessing Techniques:**
Describe the data preprocessing steps undertaken before training the machine learning models.
Include details about text preprocessing (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization), image preprocessing (e.g., resizing, normalization), and audio preprocessing (e.g., feature extraction, audio augmentation).
**Evaluation Metrics:**
Explain the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the trained models.
Provide definitions and interpretations of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.
**Model Interpretability and Explainability:**
Discuss methods for interpreting and explaining the decisions made by the trained models, especially in sensitive domains like sexual harassment detection.
Mention techniques such as feature importance analysis, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).
**Ethical Considerations:**
Address ethical considerations and potential biases associated with the dataset and model predictions.
Discuss strategies for mitigating biases and ensuring fairness in the deployment of the models.
**Privacy and Data Security:**
Highlight measures taken to ensure the privacy and security of the dataset and sensitive information related to harassment cases.
Explain any anonymization techniques used to protect the identities of individuals involved in the dataset.
**Model Deployment:**
Provide guidance on deploying the trained models in real-world applications, including considerations for scalability, latency, and model versioning.
Discuss potential deployment platforms (e.g., cloud services, edge devices) and integration with existing systems or applications.
**Future Work:**
Outline potential areas for future research and development in sexual harassment detection, such as exploring additional modalities (e.g., video, social media), addressing multilingual challenges, or incorporating user feedback mechanisms.
**References:**
Include references to relevant research papers, articles, or documentation sources cited throughout the README file.
Provide links to external resources or libraries used in the project (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).
**Visualization and Demo:**
Include visualizations (e.g., graphs, charts) of model performance, dataset characteristics, or feature importance.
Provide a demo or example code snippets demonstrating how to use the trained models for harassment detection on sample data.
**Support and Community:**
Invite users to reach out for support, ask questions, or share feedback about the project.
Provide links to project-related forums, mailing lists, or community channels where users can engage with other contributors or stakeholders.
